    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello, and welcome to my blog!</p>

<p>Everything has to start somewhere, and this blog starts here. I find that I
gather a lot of little bits and pieces of things that I tend to share with
people individually. I'll be posting these things here to serve as a
reference and hopefully help some other people along the way. Expect to see
primarily articles about technology, personal optimization, and maybe some
code here and there.</p>

<p>I hope you'll enjoy reading the things you find here.</p>
