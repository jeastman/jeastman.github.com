My name is John Eastman. I am a technologist and researcher located in
Texas near Houston.

I spend my working time looking for ways to provide
[unique access to storage](http://www.mezeo.com). Outside of work my time
is consumed with my family, much the way it should be.

For my professional details - check my [linkedin profile](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/john-eastman/0/205/495).

I've created this blog to share some of my thoughts with other people that
might be interested in them. I don't blog very often, but I do hope you'll
enjoy some of the articles here.
